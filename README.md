### Installing Dependencies

Install all required packages using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all dependencies listed in `package.json`, including development dependencies needed for building and testing the application.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run the Application

### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot reloading and Turbopack for optimal performance:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. The application automatically reloads when you make changes to the source code, providing an efficient development experience.

### Production Build

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Production Server

After building, start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

### Code Quality Checks

Run ESLint to check for code quality issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Sanity Studio

Access the content management system at `http://localhost:3000/studio` when the development server is running. This provides a user-friendly interface for managing blog posts, team information, and other dynamic content.

## üíª Relevant Code Examples

### Dynamic Project Showcase

The project showcase demonstrates advanced data management and component composition:

```typescript
// app/projects/ProjectsPage.tsx
const ProjectsPage = () => {
  const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState("All");
  const [filteredProjects, setFilteredProjects] = useState(projects);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (selectedCategory === "All") {
      setFilteredProjects(projects);
    } else {
      setFilteredProjects(
        projects.filter(project => project.category === selectedCategory)
      );
    }
  }, [selectedCategory]);

  return (
    <motion.div 
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
    >
      {/* Category filtering and project grid */}
    </motion.div>
  );
};
```

### Sanity CMS Integration

Blog posts are dynamically fetched from Sanity CMS with proper TypeScript typing:

```typescript
// sanity/lib/blogQuery.ts
export const blogPostsQuery = groq`
  *[_type == "blogPost"] | order(publishedAt desc) {
    _id,
    title,
    slug,
    excerpt,
    publishedAt,
    author->{
      name,
      image
    },
    mainImage,
    categories[]->{
      title
    }
  }
`;

// Usage in component
const BlogPostList = async () => {
  const posts = await client.fetch(blogPostsQuery);
  
  return (
    <div className="grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <BlogPostCard key={post._id} post={post} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Responsive Image Gallery

Interactive image galleries with Next.js Image optimization:

```typescript
// components/ProjectViewer.tsx
const ProjectViewer = ({ project }) => {
  const [selectedMedia, setSelectedMedia] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
      <div className="relative aspect-video">
        <Image
          src={project.gallery.images[selectedMedia]}
          alt={project.title}
          fill
          className="object-cover rounded-lg"
          sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
        {project.gallery.images.map((image, index) => (
          <button
            key={index}
            onClick={() => setSelectedMedia(index)}
            className={`relative aspect-video rounded-lg overflow-hidden
              ${selectedMedia === index ? 'ring-2 ring-purple-500' : ''}`}
          >
            <Image
              src={image}
              alt={`${project.title} thumbnail ${index + 1}`}
              fill
              className="object-cover"
            />
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Contact Form with Email Integration

Secure contact form handling with server-side email processing:

```typescript
// app/api/contact/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const { name, email, message } = await request.json();
    
    const emailData = await resend.emails.send({
      from: 'contact@voltaerotech.com',
      to: 'team@voltaerotech.com',
      subject: `New Contact Form Submission from ${name}`,
      html: `
        <h2>New Contact Form Submission</h2>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> ${name}</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> ${email}</p>
        <p><strong>Message:</strong></p>
        <p>${message}</p>
      `
    });

    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to send message' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```
